## What is it?
Pediatric Cardiac is an experimental augmented reality telemedicine app for Microsoft HoloLens that helps doctors treat pediatric cardiac arrest. It was inspired by [current research in biomedical technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554878), and is based on the American Heart Association's [pediatric cardiac arrest algorithm](https://eccguidelines.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PALS-Cardiac-Arrest-Algorithm.png).
